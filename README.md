# Python Toolbox

This is a library with different sub-libraries to provide basic functions, which can be used in data and signal processing and to compare measurement results against simulation.

### ADS_Toolbox
Functionality to import ADS Simulation Data (ASCII-File) and calculate different figure of merrits:

- ImportData: Imports an ASCII file from ads
- Calc_HarmonicBalance_Single: Calculates IP3, Psat, 1dB Compression Point based on HarmonicBalance Simulation
- Calc_HarmonicBalance: Uses Calc_HarmonicBalance_Single for multiple frequencies
- Calc_StabGain: Calculates MSG, MAG, K-Fact, Masons Gain U and Gmax based on 2-Port s2p
- Calculate_StabCircle: Generates stability circles based on 2-Port s2p
- MixedModeSparam: Calculates standart and mixed moded matricies based on 4-Port s4p
- ImportS2P: Data conversion (change in future versions)

### Basic_Toolbox
Major focus on plotting:

- CSV2Dict: script for importing CSV Files
- CSV2Area: script for calculating polygon area based on coordinates
- FitFct_Exp: script that fits data against an Exp Function
- FindPoint_FitFct: fits higher order Polynom against Dataset to find point
- Linearization_Point: linearization around one point
- Linear_Plot: linear plot function with automated labeling
- SemiLogX_Plot: semilog x plot function with automated labeling
- Vline_Plot: generates vertical line in plot with label
- Hline_Plot: generates horizontal line in plot with label
- Align_YAxis: Align two YGrids in one plot
- FindPoint_NextValue: find nearest point
- Digitalize_Data: Generates binary stream from data and clock
- CMPLX2Format: converts complex numbers in different formats
- Average: Average a Dataset
- FFTData: Generates a FFT out the Data
- String2List: Generates a List out of a csv with one line

### ControlTheory_Toolbox
Major fucus on control theorie and plotting

- Extract_Sympy_1Var: Substitutes Sympy and generates numeric solution
- BodePlot_FBCTRL: Generate BodePlot out of symbolic feedback transfer function
